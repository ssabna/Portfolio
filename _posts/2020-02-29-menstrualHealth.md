# Introduction:  

## Steps to follow for a successful blog upload:

1. Open Atom
2. If you want to upload a private file, make a new file in the "\_private" folder.  
3. If you want to upload a public blog, make a new file in the "\_posts" folder. The filename should look like: "yyyy-mm-dd-<topic_name>.md"
4. Once you're done writing, open "Github-Desktop". Enter a commit message (a short one-liner about what you just wrote) on the bottom left side of the screen and press commit. Most of the screen should display your file.
5. After committing, around the center right there will be a button called "Push Origin." Press that.
6. **Viola!!** You're done!. Visit [The Website](https://ssabna.github.io/Portfolio) in **incognito** mode to verify your **public** post has been successfully uploaded

7. Add images as explained below:   
  1. Add the image to the "images" folder.
  2. Wherever you want to add the image, write the following command:  
  ```
  ![image](/Portfolio/images/<image_name>.jpg)
  ```
  3. In the above command, any kind of image can be used(.jpg, .png, .bmp, .svg etc). It is not restricted to the use of .jpg images.
  4. Example: ![image](/Portfolio/images/guitar.jpg)
